# esportsDuo
This project was developed during the Next Level Week - RocketSeat, the main idea of the application is to connect players to play games together.

The application was developed using: 

React

TypeScript

Axios for the external connections

Radix for the components

Tailwind for the styles

Phosphor for the icons

Toastify for the toasts

To run this application you will need to run the API too, you can find it in my repositories.
